# money-rs

A CURD application to track and manage how I gain, use, and spend money across multiple currencies,
while maintaining quasi-objective sense of value regardless of how currencies change in worth over time.

Currently a WIP with horrible version history. Version control will only be taken seriously after version `1.0.0`.

Written in Rust as a chance to not get rusty on Rust (pun intended).

Current progress:
- Schema - Done
- CURD - Halfway done
- Backend advanced operations - Not started
- Functionality consolidation and backend integration tests - Not started
- Front end - Not started
- Proper readme and documentation - Not started
- Define codebase standards and adhere to them - Not started
